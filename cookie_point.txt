Q1 -  Can you explain the benefits of using a virtual environment for python applications?
1. Dependency Isolation: For example, one project can use Flask 2.0 while another uses Flask 3.0 on the same machine without any conflicts.
2. Avoid accidentally breaking your operating system's global Python installation.
3. Easy Cleanup: If you no longer need a project, you can simply delete the virtual environment folder to remove all its libraries.
